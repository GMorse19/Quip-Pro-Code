# Quip Pro Code

This is my second project as a developer. My goal was to build my own API and
also build a front end client to connect with my API. I attempted to keep the
front end fairly basic so that I would be able to focus on the small details
involved.

The project itself, is a page designed to help programmers get through their
day by boosting their morale or maybe altering their mood. A user can create a
database of all their favorite quotes and refernce them in times of despair.

## Resources

HTML
css
javascript
handlebars
Jquery
ajax

## Planning

I really wanted to begin this project with more planning than I did on the
first project. Even with the added effort, I feel I could have done even more
planning.

I began my planning by writing out some basic user stories. I now see that I
could have gone a little more in depth with these user stories, but the ones I
did write out helped me tremendously.

Next, I drew up my wireframes to accommodate my users needs. Once again, if my
user stories were more complete, my wireframes would have been a little more
complete. They did serve their purpose and allowed me to begin building my <a href="https://github.com/GMorse19/project-2-api.git">API</a>.
You can read more about that here.

Once my API was up and running, I laid out all of directories for the project
in Atom.

I created a basic layout in my index.html file with all of the features I
would need. I then worked my way through my first API call to make sure I was connected properly. I wanted to make sure I could store and retrieve my resource
as needed.

Once I was successful with my first API call, I began building the rest.

I began with a POST request, followed by a GET, PATCH and DELETE.

Setting up the API calls was a great hurdle to get over. I felt I would be the
rest of my development would be a lot easier. This wasn't necessarily the case.

I moved on to working on the logistics of my page next. This proved to be a
little more challenging than I expected. When to show certain functionality and making sure the layout still made sense was my goal here. It took some time, but
I did finally mananage to come with something acceptable.

For my next challenge I moved on to styling. While I enjoy this process, it is
not one of stron gpoints, yet. I made some strides in my CSS knowledge during
this project, but I spent most of my time testing out features and didn't end up
applying much of what I discovered. In the next version I will give it a shot.

I finsihed the project with a random choice button and cleaned up my code as
best I could.

## Unsolved Problems

I still want to worl on signing in on sign-up.

I'd like to add more searchable options. Currently you can only searc by ID.

I'd like to add an option to only update one parameter at a time.

I'd like to add a better field for adding a quote.

I'd like to add a Demoralizer button for fun. Need to keep those egos in check!

I would definitely like to achieve more on the styling front. Better button
design, better color scheme, better header and auth fields. Basically, I'd like
to really take a crack at a full makeover for the project.
